## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes

## How It Works

The application uses the `youtube-transcript` library to extract captions from YouTube videos. It supports:

- Automatic captions generated by YouTube
- Manual captions uploaded by video creators
- Multiple fallback methods for caption extraction

## Limitations

- Only works with videos that have captions/subtitles enabled
- May not work with private or age-restricted videos
- Rate limiting may apply for excessive usage

## Deployment

### Option 1: Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

Vercel is the easiest way to deploy this Next.js application with full API support.

1. Click the button below to deploy:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/WeiProduct/Youtubetotext)

2. Or deploy manually:
   - Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
   - Run `vercel` in the project directory
   - Follow the prompts

### Option 2: Deploy to GitHub Pages (Static Only)

**Note**: GitHub Pages deployment will disable the API routes. The transcript extraction won't work.

1. Update `next.config.mjs`:
```javascript
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'export',
  images: {
    unoptimized: true,
  },
}
```

2. Build and deploy:
```bash
npm run build
# The static files will be in the 'out' directory
```

### Option 3: Self-hosting

Build and run the application:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### Environment Variables

No environment variables are required for basic functionality.
